Your ability to familiarize yourself with multiple technologies, their pros and cons, and their alternatives is key to making educated decisions about how your systems should be designed."],
["2", "As a compiler developer, your top priority will be to familiarize yourself with one system better than anyone else.  The work you produce will play a key part in every workflow related to your tool.  The performance gains your projects will be responsible will be massive and could influence which tools remain in fashion for decades if the difference is stark enough"],
["3", "As a database administrator, your top priority is protecting your organization’s data.  As web continues to grow in its usage, all businesses will handle data to some extent; its proper protection and handling will primarily be your responsibility.  And when things do go wrong, you will have the greatest ability to diagnose and treat data related issues."],
["4", "As a cybersecurity analyst, your goal will be to familiarize yourself with the latest news in the tech world constantly; when a new tool has a problem, you should know if your organization depends on it..  When a new form of attack is popularized, you should know if your organization’s protocol addresses this concern.  In the best cases, you’ll have the foresight to predict them.  In the worst cases, you’ll be able to remedy them as soon as possible."],
["5", "As a devOps engineer, you will play an increasingly large role as projects continue the trend towards cloud infrastructure.  Where once it was commonplace to have separate teams handle deployment concerns, developers are now playing a larger role than ever.  A well-designed pipline can make a world of difference for a development team, allowing lightning fast turnaround and streamlined delivery processes."],
["6", "As a natural language processing engineer, you will help bridge the gap between AI and people.  Especially in recent days, AI has made tremendous advances forward, becoming almost commonplace even for people outside of the tech industry.  The greater model we can develop for modeling language, the better chance we have for precise interactions with AI, allowing better results and reduced resource requirements for their usage."],
["7", "As a front-end developer, you will almost certainly be working with a web technology.  Software development has increasingly grown dependent on web browsers to serve as the primary client application for their software.  Its widespread adoption, highly standardized practices, and continual growth as the place where we spend our time has singlehandedly brought JavaScript from a niche language to the most widespread one.  You will be the one responsible for making the user’s experience a good one from the get-go."],
["8", "As a video game developer, you will almost certainly end up wearing many hats.  As the fastest growing multi-media form of entertainment, video games have gone from fringe entertainment to mainstream.  For those bold enough to strike out on their own, there is the constant allure of making a big hit.  In some ways, this job allows you the shortest path to your target consumer."],
["9", "As a quantum computing specialist, you will be solving a problem that is still largely uncharted territory.  Similarly how AI could change the future of humanity, quantum computing will change everything we know about technology.  You’ll be heavily involved in the research process to figure out how to apply the principles, technologies, and algorithms of quantum entaglement to the domain of computing."],
["10", "As an embedded software developer, your goal will be to maximize the resources available to you on your target platform.  In a world that uses more and more silicon in technologies that never used them before, it’s important to make sure that nothing gets wasted.  You may not be able to choose how much memory will fit in a certain amount of space but you can choose how to use it.  This is the realm of maximizing performance without the constraints of higher-level technologies."],
["11", "As a blockchain developer, your goal will be to incorporate the principles of Web 3.0 to pave the way for the next generation of software applications.  With the explosion of cryptocurrencies, governments around the world are figuring out how to regulate and incorporate blockchain technologies into common life, even at a policy level.  Whether it’s the next big coin or changing how we do business, blockchain technology has a new way of doing things."],
["12", "As a computational neuroscience researcher, you will be working with neuroscientists to expand our understanding of our own minds.  The human mind still remains a mystery in exactly how it works and this remains apparent as AI models continue to expose our models of thinking as incorrect.  In this field, you’ll help bridge this gap by using software to help analyze and explore exactly how we think."],
["13", "As a full-stack developer, your duties could range anywhere from database work to working on a web technology for the front-end.  The web continues to grow in size and influence and technologies are responding by providing various stacks of technologies to facilitate this change.  Able to work in any part of the customer to company pipeline, companies are in need of software developers who can fill these gaps in nearly every industry."],
["14", "As a graphics and rendering developer, your work will widen the primary bottleneck in most software with a real-time component.  Image processing and rendering is a comptutationally expensive process and frequently dictates the tempo that anything else can be done.  By making performance gains through clever application of smart resource usage, you make the world a literally more beautiful place."],
["15", "As an AI developer, you’ll be at the forefront of one of the most anticipated software applications of all time.  With the recent advent of ChatGPT, it seems like everyone is thinking of AI and for good reason; as it becomes more useful and accessible, it will change every industry in some way or another.  By applying principles from multiple fields with the best tools available, your work will revolutionize and recontextualize everything we do as a species."]
